# Edge Function Undefined Phrase Fix

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Problem
The `download-apkg` edge function was throwing a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'lang')` error at runtime. The error occurred when trying to access the `lang` property on undefined phrase objects.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `mapSupabaseLessonToLesson` utility function. When mapping Supabase responses to Lesson objects, the function accessed `t.phrase_primary_id[0]` and `t.phrase_secondary_id[0]` without checking if:
1. The arrays were empty
2. The array elements were null or undefined

This caused undefined values to be assigned to `phrase_primary_id` and `phrase_secondary_id` in Translation objects. Later, when the download functions tried to filter phrases using `phrases.find((p) => p.lang === lesson.side_one)`, the code attempted to access `.lang` on undefined objects, causing the runtime error.

## Solution

### 1. Updated `mapSupabaseLessonToLesson` utility function
- Added optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing array elements
- Added a filter to remove translations where either phrase is undefined or null
- This ensures only valid translations with both phrases are returned

### 2. Updated `download-apkg/index.ts`
- Added filtering to remove undefined/null phrases before processing
- Added null checks for `side1` and `side2` before accessing their properties
- Improved error handling to gracefully skip invalid translations

### 3. Updated `download-csv/index.ts`
- Applied the same defensive checks as download-apkg
- Added early return for null translations
- Added validation to check if arrayForExport is empty before processing
- Returns a 404 response with helpful message if no valid translations found

### 4. Updated Translation interface type
- Changed `phrase_primary_id` and `phrase_secondary_id` to optional (`?`)
- This accurately reflects that phrases may be undefined after mapping

## Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/_shared/utilities.ts`
- `/supabase/functions/_shared/types.ts`
- `/supabase/functions/download-apkg/index.ts`
- `/supabase/functions/download-csv/index.ts`

## Impact
- Prevents runtime errors when translations have missing or null phrases
- Gracefully handles edge cases in data structure
- Improves reliability of export functionality
- Better error messages for users when data is invalid
